# In The Shadows
A 2D stealth game where you play as a famous thief. Tasked with crawling a multi-floored dungeon to steal the treasure, a large and valuable diamond, 'In The Shadows' is played in turns where the user can move and interact with the environment, and the guards can react and proceed accordingly. It is a two-dimensional pixel-based game written in Python using the Pygame framework.
