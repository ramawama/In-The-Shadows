### RESPONSIVENESS ###

Action Indications / Non-Blocking: We believe our game is responsive because

State Indications: We believe

Task Success: We believe

Task failure: We believe


### BUILD QUALITY ###

Robustness: We believe our game is robust because our code was written with error checking and handling in mind.
Every time any coordinates are called, they are wrapped in a try/except clause to make sure there is no way an out of bounds error can crash the game.
Additionally, we leveraged the use of predefined levels which are designed to be impossible to break because they are surrounded by walls which cannot be passed.
This results in a game where any user input cannot result in a crash from the users actions, there may be bugs from other functions that are out of the control of the player.

Consistency: We believe our game is consistent because we used a consistent naming scheme for all of our variables and functions.
These rules were enforced by a GitHub task on push so every coder had to conform to using the same scheme.

Aesthetic Rigor: We believe our game is aesthetically rigorous because we developed every single asset by hand without the use of any tools or libraries.
The animations are all done by hand as well so this is an entirely student-designed game which took an extreme amount of effort.
