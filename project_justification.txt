### BUILD QUALITY ###

Robustness: We believe our game is robust because our code was written with error checking and handling in mind.
Every time any coordinates are called, they are wrapped in a try/except clause to make sure there is no way an out of bounds error can crash the game.
Additionally, we leveraged the use of predefined levels which are designed to be impossible to break because they are surrounded by walls which cannot be passed.
This results in a game where any user input cannot result in a crash from the users actions, there may be bugs from other functions that are out of the control of the player.

Consistency: We believe our game is consistent because

Aesthetic Rigor: We believe our game is aesthetically rigorous because
